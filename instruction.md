# DESCRIPTION

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.
A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html or https://git-scm.com/docs.

## OPTIONS

```sh -v
--version
```
Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

This option is internally converted to git version ... and accepts the same options as the git-version command. If --help is also given, it takes precedence over --version.

```sh
-h
--help 
```
Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command.

git-status
